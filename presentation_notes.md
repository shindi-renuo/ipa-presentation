# Presentation Notes & Tips: Semantische Redmine Suche

## I. Overall Structure & Flow:

*   **Clear Narrative:** Your presentation follows a logical progression: Problem -> Solution -> Process (IPERKA) -> Details -> Demo -> Conclusion. Stick to this, as it's easy for the audience to follow.
*   **IPERKA Framework:** This is a strong organizing principle. Clearly signpost each phase as you go through it.
*   **Visuals:** You've planned for visuals (Zeitplan, Informieren-Plan, Systemaufbau, Checkbox-Showcase, etc.). Ensure these are large, clear, and directly support your points. *Tip: Briefly explain each visual; don't assume the audience will get it immediately.*
*   **Repetition of Key Terms:** Good job introducing terms like "Embedding," "pgvector," etc., early. You can subtly re-explain them if you feel the audience might need a reminder during later, more technical slides.

## II. Section-Specific Notes & Tips:

*   **1. Title & Intro (Slides 1-2):**
    *   **Tip:** Start with energy and clearly state your name and the presentation's purpose. Briefly hook the audience with the "why" – why is a better Redmine search important?
*   **2. Inhalt (Slide 3):**
    *   **Tip:** Quickly go over the agenda. This sets expectations. Don't spend too long here.
*   **3. Die Aufgabe (Slide 4):**
    *   **Problem Statement:** Clearly articulate the pain points of the standard Redmine search.
    *   **Relate to Audience:** If possible, briefly mention if anyone in the audience might have experienced these issues.
    *   **Goal:** Emphasize the objective: AI-gestützte, semantische Suche.
*   **4. Die Lösung (Slide 5):**
    *   **"What is it?":** Explain the semantic search plugin in simple terms first, then introduce the technologies.
    *   **Keywords:** Highlight "AI-Embeddings" and "Vektorsuche" as the core concepts.
*   **5. Projektmanagement: IPERKA (Slide 6):**
    *   **Explain IPERKA:** Briefly define what IPERKA stands for if the audience isn't familiar with it.
    *   **Tip:** You can say something like, "To manage this project effectively, I used the IPERKA model, which I'll walk you through now."
*   **6. Zeitplan (Slide 7):**
    *   **Visual Aid:** Let the image do most of the talking. Point out the 10-day timeframe and the IPERKA structure within it.
*   **7. Informieren (Slides 8-9):**
    *   **Ausgangslage & Ziel:** Reiterate the core problem and the project's aim.
    *   **Wichtige Begriffe:** Define "Embedding," "pgvector," and "OpenAI API" clearly. *Tip: Use analogies if possible to make "Embedding" more understandable (e.g., "it's like a numerical fingerprint for text").*
*   **8. Systemaufbau (Slide 10):**
    *   **Clarity:** Use the diagram to explain the interaction between Redmine, the plugin, AI, and the database. Keep it high-level.
*   **9. Zugriffskontrolle (Slide 11):**
    *   **Roles:** Clearly differentiate between Admin and Product Owner/Developer roles and their permissions. The GIF will be helpful here.
*   **10. Planen (Slide 12):**
    *   **Datenmodell:** Explain the `IssueEmbedding` relation simply.
    *   **Testkonzept:** Briefly explain *why* automated and manual tests were important (quality, early bug detection).
*   **11. Entscheiden (Slide 13):**
    *   **Model Choice:** Justify the choice of OpenAI (reliability for IPA) while acknowledging Ollama as an alternative.
    *   **Vektorgrössen:** Explain the "Zero Padding" solution simply. Don't get bogged down in technical jargon unless the audience is highly technical.
*   **12. Realisieren (Slide 14):**
    *   **Highlights:** Focus on the *key* implementation steps. You don't need to detail every line of code.
    *   **Two Columns:** Clearly present "Setup & Embedding" and "Suche" separately.
*   **13. Kontrollieren (Slide 15):**
    *   **Actions & Manual:** Differentiate between automated checks (GitHub Actions) and manual/feedback-driven tests.
    *   **Outcomes:** Mention the "Doku-Wunsch für Ollama" – shows self-reflection.
*   **14. Suchqualität (Slide 16):**
    *   **Comparison:** This is a key slide. Clearly explain the difference in how OpenAI and Ollama approach relevance (semantic vs. keyword).
    *   **Example:** The "Passwort"-Suche example is excellent. Make it very clear how "Fix login redirect bug" is semantically similar to "Update password policy" even without the word "password."
*   **15. Auswerten (Slide 17):**
    *   **Zielerreichung:** Confidently state that core requirements were met.
    *   **Erkenntnisse:** The points about pragmatism, padding, and local models are good takeaways.
*   **16. L2-Distanz (Slides 18-19):**
    *   **Math Formula:** Don't just show the formula; explain it conceptually. The "Pythagoras in mehreren Dimensionen" analogy is good.
    *   **"Luftlinie":** This is a great way to explain it.
    *   **Example (Slide 19):**
        *   The `EuclideanDistance` component will be a visual aid.
        *   Walk through the Javascript code snippet conceptually if you feel it's necessary, focusing on what it *does* (calculates distance, sorts by it) rather than a line-by-line analysis.
        *   The reference vector and sorted results make it concrete.
*   **17. Fazit (Slide 20):**
    *   **Main Message:** Reiterate the success and value.
    *   **Future:** Briefly touch on improvement potential – shows forward-thinking.
*   **18. Live-Demonstration (Slide 21):**
    *   **Tip:** *Practice this extensively!* Ensure the demo environment is stable.
    *   **Narrate:** Explain what you're doing at each step of the demo.
    *   **Cover the Points:** Make sure to hit all four points listed (Konfiguration, Embedding-Generierung, Suchbeispiele, Zugriffsrechte).
*   **19. Anerkennungen (Slide 22):**
    *   **Sincerity:** Deliver this genuinely.
*   **20. Fragen & Antworten (Slide 23):**
    *   **Tip:** Be prepared for questions. It's okay to say "That's a great question, I'd need to look into the specifics to give you a precise answer" if you don't know something.
    *   **Open Body Language:** Be approachable.

## III. General Presentation Tips:

*   **Know Your Audience:** Tailor the depth of technical explanations to who you're presenting to.
*   **Pacing:** Don't rush, but also don't drag. Find a comfortable pace. The IPERKA structure should help with a natural flow.
*   **Enthusiasm:** Your passion for the project will be contagious.
*   **Eye Contact:** Engage with your audience by making eye contact with different people.
*   **Voice:** Speak clearly and vary your tone. Avoid a monotone.
*   **Body Language:** Stand confidently. Use gestures naturally to emphasize points.
*   **Handle Questions:** Listen carefully to questions. Repeat or rephrase them if necessary to ensure everyone heard and you understood.
*   **Transitions:** Use transition phrases between sections (e.g., "Now that we've looked at the planning phase, let's move on to how it was realized...").
*   **Breathe:** Take moments to pause and breathe, especially during transitions.
*   **Time Management:** Be mindful of your allotted time. Practice to get a feel for how long each section takes. The Zeitplan slide could even be a subtle reminder for yourself.
*   **Technical Backup:** If doing a live demo, have screenshots or a video backup in case of technical glitches.

## IV. Interesting Tips Based on Your Content:

*   **"Show, Don't Just Tell":** Your inclusion of diagrams (`Systemaufbau`), GIFs (`checkbox-showcase`), and code snippets (`L2-Distanz Beispiel`) is great. Lean into this. When discussing the L2-Distanz, the visual example and then the code make it more tangible.
*   **Highlighting Decision Rationale:** You do this well on the "Entscheiden" slide (OpenAI vs. Ollama). Explaining *why* a decision was made is often as important as the decision itself.
*   **Relating to Real-World Problems:** The initial "Problem" statement makes the solution immediately relevant.
*   **Honesty in Evaluation:** Mentioning the "Doku-Wunsch für Ollama" during "Kontrollieren" shows a balanced and honest assessment.
*   **The Power of Analogy:** Your L2-Distanz explanation ("Pythagoras in mehreren Dimensionen", "Luftlinie") is a good example. Use analogies where possible for complex topics.
